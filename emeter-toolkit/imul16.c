//This routine implements a 16x16->32 2's complement multiplier. If a hardware
//multiplier is available it is used. If no hardware multiplier is available,
//Booth's algorithm is used to directly implement a signed multiplier in software.
//C does not normally express a 16x16->32 operation, and the speedup of achieving
//a 32-bit answer by a full 32x32 multiply is substantial.
